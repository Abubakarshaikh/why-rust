# Why Rust

This is an OSS talk about the Rust programming language. The talk
explains what is Rust good for,  what companies are using it an and why
people love it.

Feel free to reuse this talk :).

Thanks to Niko Matsakis and Philipp Oppermann from whom I took some
inspiration.

## TODO

- Add more slides related to success stories using Rust
- Explain a bit better Rust use cases, come up with examples of the
  usages on each of the listed possibilities
- Add speakers note to explain the intention of each slide so the talk
  idea remain between speakers using this talk
- Tidy up markup and css, it's too untidy right now
